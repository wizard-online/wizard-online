## Run Typescript type checks
This project uses Babel to to transpile Typescript code to browser-readable javascript instead of the Typescript compiler.
Babel does not check for correct typings but basically strips all type information away.
To run type checks manually you can run:
```sh
> yarn run type-check
```

## Run Linter
Use this command to run ESLint and Stylelint:
```sh
> yarn run lint
```

Or run them separately:

ESLint:
```sh
> yarn run lint:es
```

Stylelint:
```sh
> yarn run lint:style
```

## Recommended IDE

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with EsLint  extension
